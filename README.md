## Prerequisites

* Node.js "https://nodejs.org/en"
* Javascript "https://javascript.com"
* VS Code "https://code.visualstudio.com"
* Google Chrome "https://google.com"
* Express "https://expressjs.com"
* Github "https://github.com"

## Installation

To ensure the app is making sensible use of the request/response cycle:
* All mathematical logic **must** be implemented on the server.
* Calculation history data **must** be stored on the server.
* The client-side code **must** be able to:
  * Ask the server for its calculation history, then render it appropriately on the DOM.
  * Obtain "new calculation" data via user input, then send it to the server.

1. Ensure node and npm are installed.
2. Start the application by running "nmp start".
3. Open the web browser and go to HTTP://localhost:5001 to view and operate calculator on DOM.
4. Run "npm test" often to be certain functions and code are achieving desired outcomes.

## Usage

1. User enters 1st number into input field #1.
2. User clicks button to choose operator of choice (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
3. User enters 2nd number into input field #2.
4. User selects "equals" button to run calculation.
5. User views most recent calculation result below calculator input fields.
6. User views history of calculation results below most recent result.
7. User selects "C" button to clear the input fields.
